### nodejs/loaders

* Roadmap for experimental TypeScript support [#217](https://github.com/nodejs/loaders/issues/217)

- Marco: new API to perform transpilation the same way Node does in module <https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/55282>
- Marco: For the future having a flag TS flag compatible <https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/59601> with experimental-strip-types would make it easier to unflag
- Jake: Not possible for 5.7 beta is already cut, discussion ongoing. Maybe some details will be different from the current strip-types implementation <https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/59601>
- Marco: As soon as 5.7 is out will be adding documentation to the website.
- Jake: 5.7 documentation will contain details on what the new flag looks like and caveats.
