### nodejs/typescript

* Roadmap to stable strip-types [#24](https://github.com/nodejs/typescript/issues/24)
Marco:
* working improving errors, currently blocked by swc.
* need to create a tsconfig for users

* Jake: probably better to add it to <https://github.com/tsconfig/bases> instead of creating a CLI tool.
    > Lucas volunteered (wait until 5.8 is out on beta and state that it will only work for the beta in the description).
* Lucas: maybe ask the maintainers if anyone in the Node.js TS team can join the org to maintain the Node.js specific files.
* Marco: plan to unflag on v22 after a couple more releases v23 releases.
* Augustin: should we suggest in which cases users should use strip-types.
* Marco: we should wait for stabilization before recommending something.
* Marco: things going smoothly so far, no major blockers.
