## Agenda

## Announcements

* Extracted from **typescript-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.
  * Jacob: The correct specifiers codemod has successfully migrated the Puppeteer monorepo, so I think it's ready to go (JakobJingleheimer/correct-ts-specifiers#9). I need to add a few test cases and polish docs, but I expect it to be ready to publish in the next few days.

### nodejs/loaders

* Roadmap for experimental TypeScript support [#217](https://github.com/nodejs/loaders/issues/217)

### nodejs/typescript

* Type Stripping in `node_modules/*/*.ts` [#14](https://github.com/nodejs/typescript/issues/14)
  * Marco:  No need to support it for the unflagging, it can wait.
  * Daniel: Right now don't think it's a good idea, but not definitive.
  * Jacob: use engines section of package.json to mitigate some the incompatibility issues
  * Marco: probably enable it behind a flag
  * Daniel: monorepo use symlinks so don't need it
  * Andrew: monorepo already work, maybe does not work when publishing .ts files internally
  * Daniel: If users wants to use workspaces, that is already documented
  * Jacob: monorepo in fact works, tested in codemod
  * Marco: We believe monorepo use-cases should all work, we will re-evaluate after the feature becomes more stable.

* Unflag `--experimental-strip-types` [#17](https://github.com/nodejs/typescript/issues/17)
  * Jacob: volunteers to document how to publish a typescript package on npm
  * Daniel: ts 5.7 landing tomorrow
  * Daniel: About the ack from TypeScript team, exciting, the missing piece is providing errors in the IDE but no blockers.
  * Marco: transform types might always stay behind a flag, source maps should not be enabled by default. Marco should we wait to unflag, for a TS compatible flag?
  * Daniel: Not a big deal, it's ok
  * Conclusion: TS team are ok with unflagging
  * TS Issue for option to disallow features requiring transformations which are not supported by Node.js' --strip-types:  <https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/59601>
  * Andrew/Daniel:  The plan is for TS to add the lint flag in TS 5.8 (the next release)
  * Marco: Documentation was added: <https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/typescript.html#type-stripping>
  * Marco: Talking about next steps, should we ping frontend frameworks?
  * Daniel: Would be good but not necessary
